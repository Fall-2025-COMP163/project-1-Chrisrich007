COMP 163 - Project 1: Character Creator & Saving/Loading

Author
Christopher Arnold – COMP 163, Fall 2025

Description

This program is an interactive Character Creator that allows users to design and manage a game hero. Players choose a name and class, view their character stats, and save or load their progress from a text file. The project focuses on file input/output operations, data validation, and error handling without using try/except blocks.

The system supports creating, saving, loading, and leveling up characters, while gracefully handling potential issues such as missing files, invalid input, or permission restrictions.

Program Concept

Players begin by entering their hero’s name and selecting a valid class — Warrior, Mage, Rogue, or Cleric.
Each class has its own base stats for Strength, Magic, and Health, which increase as the character levels up.

The program flow includes:

Character Creation: Input name and class, then generate initial stats and gold.

File Saving: Save the character’s stats to a text file (hero.txt) if the directory is writable.

File Loading: Load character data from the saved file if it exists.

Leveling Up: Recalculate stats and increase gold as the character progresses.

Display: Show all character details in a formatted sheet.

AI Usage

Assistance from ChatGPT (GPT-5) was used for:

Structuring function logic (especially calculate_stats() and file handling) and os functions.

Designing balanced stat formulas for each class.

Drafting documentation and explanatory comments.

All logic was fully reviewed, tested, and understood by me and the TA
